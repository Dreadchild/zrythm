# Dependencies
- Suil with GTK3 support is needed. Some repos don't have it yet so first install latest Suil
- Other dependencies should show up when `configure` is run if they are missing. Install using a package manager

# Compile

```
autoreconf --install
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
```

# Install
```
sudo make install
```
