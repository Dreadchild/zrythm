# Dependencies
- Suil with GTK3 support is needed. Some distros don't have the latest versions so might have to manually install
- Other dependencies should show up when `configure` is run if they are missing. Install using the distro's package manager

# Compile
```
autoreconf --install
./configure
make -j8
```

# Run
```
build/debug/zrythm

# Install
```
sudo make install
```
