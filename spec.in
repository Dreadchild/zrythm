%description
Zrythm is a free modern music production system, also known
as DAW. It aims to be highly modular, meaning everything
should be automatable and inter-connectable, making it
suitable for electronic music.

It is written in C and it uses the GTK+3 toolkit. Bits and
pieces are taken from other programs like Ardour and Jalv.
