Contributing
============

Coding
------

Please see the
`Contributing Guide <https://docs.zrythm.org/md_CONTRIBUTING.html>`_ and check out the
`Developer Docs <https://docs.zrythm.org/>`_.
These have a lot of information about how
to contribute code and various guidelines to follow.

Artwork and Themes
------------------

Zrythm is mostly CSS themable and also makes use of
many icons, some customized and some borrowed from
other themes. If you would like to contribute
artwork such as icons, please discuss with us first
as icon preferences are very subjective.

For making themes, you can take a look in
https://git.zrythm.org/cgit/zrythm/tree/resources/theme.css
to get an idea of how CSS in GTK+3 works.
We also recommend looking at the
`CSS Overview <https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/chap-css-overview.html>`_ section
in the GTK+3 docs.

We currently have a shortage of testers and you
