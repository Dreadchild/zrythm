Automation Lanes
================

Tracks which have automatable controls, such
as Fader, Pan and parameters of Plugins they
contain will have an option to show their
Automation Lanes.

You can choose which parameter you want to
automate in each Automation Lane.

Types of Automatable Parameters
-------------------------------

Zrythm will draw the automation differently
depending on the type of the parameter being
automated. The following types of parameters
exist.

Float
  Parameters with a Float type can have a value
  of any decimal within their given range and
  are the most common ones. Zrythm will draw
  editable curves for these types of
  parameters.
Step
  Step parameters have values that can only
  be changed in increments. Zrythm will draw
  ladders for these types of parameters.
Boolean
  These types of parameters only have two
  values: On or Off. Zrythm will draw a big
  square for these.
