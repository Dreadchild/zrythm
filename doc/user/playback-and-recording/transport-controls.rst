When metronome is enabled, you will hear metronome
ticks during playback at each bar and each tick.
The tick at each bar will be more emphasized.
This is useful for making sure your song stays
on beat.

.. tip:: The metronome samples can be overridden by
  placing your own samples in your Zrythm directory.
  This is a TODO feature.
