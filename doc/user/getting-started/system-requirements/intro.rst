System Requirements
===================

Minimum Requirements
--------------------
We don't know yet. The oldest machine tested on was T400 and it was a bit laggy. If you have any experiences with older machines please let us know.

Recommended Requirements
------------------------
We recommend running a fairly modern machine.

Audio Interface
---------------
An Audio Interface is recommended as it offers low latency and better quality (especially if recording audio).

JACK
----
JACK needs to be set up and configured before running Zrythm. We recommend using `Cadence <http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Applications%3ACadence>`_, as it makes the process very easy.

* Open Cadence
