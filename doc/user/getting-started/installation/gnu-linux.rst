GNU with Linux

Installer
---------
You can install the latest version of
Zrythm for your distro using an installer
from the
`Download <https://www.zrythm.org/en/download.html>`_ page
on our website.

The installer supports the following
distros (and derivatives):

- **Ubuntu 18.04, 19.10 & 20.04** - amd64
- **LinuxMint 19.3** - amd64
- **Debian 9 & 10** - amd64
- **Arch Linux** - x86_64
- **Fedora 32** - x86_64
- **OpenSUSE Tumbleweed** - x86_64

This is the easiest and recommended way to install
the latest version for most users, and we provide
support for it.

Distribution Package
--------------------
If your distribution provides a Zrythm package you
can install it from there.

Manual Installation
-------------------
If you are an advanced user and prefer to build Zrythm
yourself, you can build Zrythm from source, either using
a `source distribution tarball <https://www.zrythm.org/releases/>`_
or `git <https://git.zrythm.org/cgit/zrythm/>`_.

See the ``INSTALL.md`` file in the source distribution for
installation instructions.
