FreeBSD
=======

Installer
---------
We plan to add FreeBSD support to the installer
mentioned in :ref:`gnu-with-linux-installer`.

This is the easiest and recommended way to install
the latest version for most users, and we provide
support for it.

Port
----
You can install the `zrythm port <https://www.freshports.org/audio/zrythm/>`_
but it may be old and missing features and optimizations.

Manual Installation
-------------------
See :ref:`gnu-with-linux-manual-installation`.
