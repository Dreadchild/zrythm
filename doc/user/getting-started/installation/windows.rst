Windows
=======

A Windows installer is available for purchase at
the `Download <https://www.zrythm.org/en/download.html>`_
page on our website.

We provide support for the installer, however we do not
provide support for manually building Zrythm on Windows.
If you want to try, you can find most packages needed
from the
`MSYS2 project <https://packages.msys2.org/>`_.
