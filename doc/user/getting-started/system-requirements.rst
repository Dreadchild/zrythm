System Requirements
===================

Minimum Requirements
--------------------

Hardware
~~~~~~~~
- x86_64, i686 or ARM processor

Operating System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Unix-compatible OS or Windows

Recommended
-----------
We recommend running a fairly modern machine with the
following specs so you can take full advantage of
Zrythm.

Hardware
~~~~~~~~
- A fast processor
- Large enough monitor
- Audio interface
- MIDI keyboard

Software
~~~~~~~~
- A JACK patchbay such as
  `QjackCtl <https://qjackctl.sourceforge.io/>`_,
  `Catia <https://kx.studio/Applications:Catia>`_ or
  `Ingen <https://drobilla.net/software/ingen>`_

Audio Interface
---------------
An Audio Interface is recommended as it offers
low latency and better quality (especially if recording audio).

JACK
----
When using JACK, JACK needs to be set up and configured
before running Zrythm. You will find lots of information
online about how to configure JACK, so we will skip this
part.
