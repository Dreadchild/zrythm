System Requirements
===================

Hardware
--------
- x86_64, i686 or ARM processor

Operating System
----------------
- GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Windows or MacOS

Recommendations
---------------

CPU
  For smooth operation, it is recommended to use a CPU with at
  least 2GHz clock speed and at least 4 cores in total.
Monitor
  It is recommended to have at least 16 inches of monitor space
  to work efficiently with Zrythm.
Audio interface
  An audio interface offers low latency and better quality than
  on-board sound cards (especially if recording audio).
MIDI keyboard
  For quickly trying out melodies or recording.

JACK
----
When using the JACK backend, JACK needs to be set up and configured
before running Zrythm. You will find lots of information
online about how to configure JACK, so we will skip this
part.
