Overview
========

Zrythm is a highly automated Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)
designed to be featureful and intuitive to use.
Zrythm sets itself apart from other DAWs by allowing
extensive automation via built-in LFOs and envelopes (
Modulators) and intuitive MIDI or audio editing and arranging
via loopable clips.

In the usual Composing -> Mixing -> Mastering workflow,
Zrythm puts the most focus on the Composing part. It allows
musicians to quickly lay down and process their musical
ideas without taking too much time for unnecessary work.
