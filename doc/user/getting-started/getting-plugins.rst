Getting Plugins
===============

Until Zrythm ships with its own bundled plugins, you must
install some plugins like synthesizers and effects before
you can make music.

Fortunately, there are many plugins to choose from. This guide
will show you a few ways you can install plugins.

If you are on Debian/Ubuntu, we highly recommend checking out
the `KXstudio repositories <https://kx.studio/>`_, since
there are many plugins that can easily be installed via apt.

If you are on Arch GNU/Linux you're in luck, because you can
just download the entire
`pro-audio <https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/pro-audio/>`_
or `lv2-plugins <https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/lv2-plugins/>`_
groups, or you can hand-pick the plugins you want from
there.

If you are not sure where to start, please read on.

Recommended Plugin Bundles

get you started for music making right away.

basic effects like Delay, Reverb, Compression, EQ, Saturation, etc.

**A LOT** of MIDI effect and meter plugins.

Synths
------

`Helm <https://tytel.org/helm/>`_ is an excellent subtractive synth that should be on
everyone's toolbox.

`ZynFusion <http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/zyn-fusion.html>`_, the alternative
front-end to ZynAddSubFX is one of the most
powerful synths in existance.

Percussion Generators

`GeonKick <https://gitlab.com/iurie/geonkick>`_ is a great
kick drum synthesizer that can also synthesize other types of
percussion.
