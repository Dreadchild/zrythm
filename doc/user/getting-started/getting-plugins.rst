Getting Plugins
===============

Zrythm ships with a few bundled plugins to help you get
started (currently only ZLFO), but you should
install some plugins like synthesizers and effects before
you can make music.

Fortunately, there are many plugins to choose from. This guide
will show you a few ways you can install plugins.

If you are on Debian/Ubuntu, we highly recommend using
the `KXstudio repositories <https://kx.studio/>`_, since
there are many plugins that can easily be installed via apt.

If you are on Arch GNU/Linux, we recommend installing the
`lv2-plugins <https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/lv2-plugins/>`_
group, or you can hand-pick the plugins you want from
there.

If you are not sure where to start, please read on.
