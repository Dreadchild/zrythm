"The easiest and recommended way to add tracks is to drag a plugin or an "
"audio clip from the browser on the right into the tracklist. This will "
"automatically create a track of the appropriate type (Instrument, Bus or "
"Audio). If it is an audio track, this will also place the audio clip at "
"the playhead position. If it is an instrument track, it will be ready to "
"accept MIDI signals. If it is a bus track, it will automatically place "
"the selected plugin at the first position in the channel strip."
