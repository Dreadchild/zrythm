Toolbox
-------
The Toolbox contains the following Tools that
are used to trigger modes for
specific operations.

Selection Tool
  The Selection Tool is the smartest Tool and
  while its main functionality is to select
  and move objects, it can also create or edit
  objects in various ways.
Edit Tool
  Also known as the Pencil Tool, this Tool is
  used to create objects by single-clicking
  and dragging. In the drum view of the Piano
  Roll, it can be used to quickly generate
  multiple hits.
Erase Tool
  The Erase Tool is used to delete all objects
  that are selected by it.

Each tool can be selected
by simply pressing its corresponding button
from 1 to 5 on the keyboard.
Each Mode triggered by each tool is further
