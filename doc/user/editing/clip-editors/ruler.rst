The ruler will display more or less information depending on
the current zoom level. It will also display the
following markers and indicators.

Clip start position
  Displayed as a blue, right-pointing arrow. This controls
  the position where the clip will start playback from.
Playhead position
  Shown as a grey, down-facing arrow. This is the current
  position of the playhead.
Loop points
  Shown as 2 green arrows. These control where the clip
  will start looping at and where it will return to after
  looping.

Clicking and dragging on empty space in the ruler will
allow you to reposition the playhead.

Setting Each Point
---------------------
To set the position of each point, click on it and drag it to
the desired position.
