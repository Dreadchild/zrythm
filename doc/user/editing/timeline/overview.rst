Overview
========
Editing in the timeline is the most common workflow inside
Zrythm. The timeline section consists of the tracklist on the
left and the ruler/arranger on the right side.

Tracklist
---------

   :align: center

At the top of the tracklist, the number of visible tracks
over the number of total tracks is shown, as well as
a search box for searching tracks by name (not
operational at the moment).

The rest of the tracklist is briefly touched upon at
:ref:`tracklist`.

The tracklist is split between the pinned tracks
at the top and the unpinned tracks at the bottom.
You can pin tracks to make them stick to the top, and
this is useful for chord progressions and markers,
so you can always see them.

For more details about track operations, see the :ref:`tracks`
section.

Ruler/Arranger
--------------
This section contains the timeline events and various
ruler markers. It is similarly split to match the
tracklist on the left.
