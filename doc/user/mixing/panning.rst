Panning
=======

Channels can be panned Left to Right by dragging the Pan slider.
Zrythm supports Linear Pan, Square Root Pan and Sine Law Pan, with
a Pan Law of -6dB, -3dB, or 0dB.

These settings are configurable through the Preferences window. The
default is Sine Law with -3dB. If you don't understand what these mean,
it's best to leave them to their default values.
