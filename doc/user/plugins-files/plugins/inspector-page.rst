Inspector Page
==============

When a Plugin is selected in the Mixer, its
page will appear in the Inspector as follows.

.. image:: /_static/img/plugin_inspector.png
   :align: center

This page will display information about the
Plugin and its ports and allow you to make
changes.

Changing Values
---------------

The values of control ports can be changed by
clicking and dragging inside the bar.

Connections
-----------

Compatible ports can be connected to one another.
This allows you to route anything-to-anything.
For example, you can route an LFO's CV output to
a filter plugin's cutoff parameter.

The number in orange indicates how many ports
are currently connected to each port.

By double clicking the port, you can select a
port to connect it to, or edit existing connections.
