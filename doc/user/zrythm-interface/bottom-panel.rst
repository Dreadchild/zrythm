Piano Roll
~~~~~~~~~~

The Piano Roll, or MIDI Arranger, is the most commonly used
editor.
It can be used to edit MIDI regions, which contain MIDI notes.
When a MIDI Region is selected, the Editor tab will display the
Piano Roll, allowing you to edit that region.

Automation Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Zrythm, automation is also enclosed in regions (called Automation
Regions). This allows automation to be repeated, much like MIDI Regions.
The Automation Editor will appear in the Editor tab when an Automation
Region is selected.
