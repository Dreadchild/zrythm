Timeline
========

The timeline is the main area where the song is composed. It generally
consists of a collection of events - mostly regions - that are
positioned against time. Some events will open separate windows for
further editing when clicked.

The Timeline is split into a top timeline that remains fixed on top,
and a scrollable timeline below it. This way you can pin tracks you
want to always be visible at the top.
