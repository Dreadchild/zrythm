Zrythm is a highly automated Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) designed to be featureful and intuitive to use. Zrythm sets itself apart from other DAWs by allowing extensive automation via built-in LFOs and envelopes and intuitive MIDI or audio editing and arranging via clips.

In the usual Composing -> Mixing -> Mastering workflow, Zrythm puts the most focus on the Composing part. It allows musicians to quickly lay down and process their musical ideas without taking too much time for unnecessary work.

It is written in C and uses the GTK+3 toolkit, with bits and pieces taken from other programs like Ardour and Jalv. Zrythm is free software licensed under the GPLv3+.
