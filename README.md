Zrythm is a free modern music production system, also known as DAW.
It aims to be highly modular, meaning everything should be automatable and inter-connectable, making it suitable for electronic music.

It is written in C and it uses the GTK+3 toolkit. Bits and pieces are taken from other programs like Ardour and Jalv.
