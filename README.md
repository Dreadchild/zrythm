Zrythm is a free modern music production system, also known as DAW.
It aims to be highly modular, meaning everything should be automatable and inter-connectable, making it suitable for electronic music.

It is written in C and it uses the GTK+3 toolkit.

## Currently supported protocols:
- LV2

Some code, ideas and help come from Ardour so big thanks to them.

## Why another DAW?
Partly because of curiosity, partly because I want to work with GTK/C, partly because I wanted an easily customizable UI, and also because current Free, GNU/Linux DAWs don't offer usability features I got used to from proprietary programs like Bitwig/Cubase.
